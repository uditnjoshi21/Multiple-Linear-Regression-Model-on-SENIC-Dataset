# Multiple-Linear-Regression-Model-on-SENIC-Dataset
Build the "Multiple Linear Regression Model" including interaction terms to determine which predictor variables in the SENIC dataset can help better understand and
predict the patient's length of stay in the US hospitals.


## High-level problem statement-
The goal of the analysis is to determine which predictor variables in this dataset can help to better understand and predict the length of stay of the patient in the US 
hospital by building the multiple linear regression model.

## Details-
The primary objective of the Study on the Efficacy of Nosocomial Infection Control (SENIC Project) was to determine whether infection surveillance and control programs 
have reduced the rates of nosocomial hospital-acquired) infection in United States hospitals. This data set consists of a random sample of 113 hospitals selected from the
original 338 hospitals surveyed. The data presented here are for the 1975-76 study period.    

The dataset contains 113 samples (rows) and 11 variables.



## Description of the variables in the dataset (in ascending order)-
 **• Length of Stay (Y)** - 
The average length of stay of all patients in hospital (in days). 

 **• Age (X1)** - 
The average age of patients (in years). 

**• Infection Risk (X2)** - 
The average estimated probability of acquiring infection in hospital (in percent). 

**• Routine Culturing Ratio (X3)** -  The ratio of the number of cultures performed to the number of patients without signs or symptoms of hospital-acquired infection, times 100. 

**• Routine Chest X-ray Ratio (X4)** - 
The ratio of the number of X-rays performed to the number of patients without signs or symptoms of pneumonia, times 100. 

**• Number of Beds (X5)** - 
The average number of beds in the hospital during the study period. 

**• Medical School (X6)** - 
Indicator of whether the hospital is associated with a medical school (1 = Yes, 2 = No). 

**• Region (X7)** - 
Indicator of the geographic region for hospital (1 = NE, 2 = NC, 3 = S, 4 = W). 

**• Average daily Census (X8)** - 
The average number of patients per day in the hospital during the study period. 

**• Number of nurses (X9)** - 
The average number of full-time equivalent registered and licensed practical nurses during the study period (number of full-time plus one-half the number of part-time). 

**• Available facilities and services (X10)** -  
Percent of 35 potential facilities and services that are provided by the hospital.
